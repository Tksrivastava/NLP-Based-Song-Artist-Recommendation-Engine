# NLP-Based-Song-Artist-Recommendation-Engine
In this digital era of Data Science and Machine Learning, people have already built numerous prediction models and recommendation engines of us to improve the user experience, prediction capabilities, and many more things. Because of that every one of us prefer our own personalized system which is fully trained to recommend movies, songs, products, places, and etc. to us. In any music streaming platform like Spotify, YouTube Music, and etc. they have their own recommendation engines which recommends songs, and artists to a user based on their preference or previous activity. In this project we have built a NLP based song artist recommendation engine for MBTI personality types based on both collaborative filtering and Ranking Algorithm. For generating the recommendations we have used genre, word, and theme preference of each personality type.
